# sticky-navbar
In the project, our aim is to design a sticky navbar that alters its color as we scroll down the webpage. 
The final version of the project will feature an image in the background of the main section, with a navbar at the top displaying a logo and menu.
As we scroll down, we will come across some Lorem ipsum-style text. As we continue to scroll, the navbar's color will change to black.
To accomplish this, we will utilize JavaScript to calculate a specific point that has not been reached and add or remove classes to achieve different styles for the navbar.
